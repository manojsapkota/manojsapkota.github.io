<p>I am <strong>Manoj Sapkota</strong>, Genomics Postdoc at <a href="https://breedinginsight.org/">Breeding Insight</a> in Cornell University. I am passionate about plant breeding, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics. I call myself a grounded and solution-oriented plant scientist with wide variety of research experiences. I possess 6 plus years of experience in bioinformatics, statistics, plant breeding, traditional gene cloning, QTL mapping, molecular cloning, and gene editing. I am adept at motivating self and others. I am also highly organized, detail oriented and capable of taking leadership role to carry out assigned projects. I call myself an excellent team player and believe that we can achieve huge success working together. I am known as being very helpful and versatile among my colleagues.</p>
<p>In my current role, I collaborate with USDA breeders working on specialty crops  ranging from diploids to polyploids like alfalfa, lettuce, blueberry, and cucumber in projects related to exploring genetic diversity, QTL mapping, GWAS and Genomic selections. Additionally, I perform genomic and bioinformatics analysis to help breeders develop breeding strategies and prepare reports, manuscripts, and presentations to share research results and findings. I also contribute to the development of <a href="https://breedinginsight.org/breeding-solutions/open-source-dartag-marker-panels/">marker panels</a> for the abovementioned crop species.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://plantbreeding.caes.uga.edu/">Institute of Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Genomics</a> at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, US and a member of <a href="https://vanderknaaplab.uga.edu/index.html">van der Knaap lab</a> working under the supervision of Dr. Esther van der Knaap.</p>
<p>I am originally from Nepal. I did my undergrad in the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Sciences at the Tribhuvan University, Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal. I had also worked as a Reserch Technician at International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), Nepal before I came to UGA to pursue my PhD.</p>

<h2 id="my-labhttpsbreedinginsightorgteam"><a href="https://breedinginsight.org/team/"><strong>My lab</strong></a></h2>
<p>Currently, I am Genomics Postdoc at <a href="https://breedinginsight.org/">Breeding Insight</a> at Cornell University working with an amazing <a href="https://breedinginsight.org/team/">team</a>. I am supervised by Dr. Dongyan Zhao and Dr. Moira Sheehan. At Breeding Insight, we level the playing field for routine use of genomics insights, creating new opportunities for specialty breeders to adopt tools, technologies and methods from basic research. We integrate phenomics (trait analysis), genomics (genotypic data), data management, and software tools to help breeders increase rates of genetic gain, which results in more healthy, nutritious, and sustainable food for consumers.</p>

Previously, I was a member of <a href="https://vanderknaaplab.uga.edu/index.html">van der Knaap lab</a> at the UGA. I am supervised by Dr. Esther van der Knaap. The lab works on exploring the genetics behind fruit and floral organ development. My research work focused on identifying and characterizing novel loci associated with tomato fruit size and flavor volatiles.</p>
<h2 id="science-communicationhttpssciencemanojtumblrcom"><a href="https://sciencemanoj.tumblr.com"><strong>Science communication</strong></a></h2>
<p>I like to communicate my science whenever I get an opportunity. I believe science is nothing without communication. I have participated in several conferences, events and competitions and presented my work (both virtual and in person). You can go through some of my posters and my recorded research talks here in my <a href="https://sciencemanoj.tumblr.com"><strong>science blog.</strong></a>

<p>You will always find me with a camera in my hand while I am travelling. I like capturing memories. I like to take potrait images and since I am around plants most of the time you can see plenty of plant potraits in my collection. <a href="https://manoj34sapkota.tumblr.com"><strong>Here are some of my collections.</strong></a>

<h2 id="travelling-and-exploring-new-places"><strong>Travelling and exploring new places</strong></h2>
<p>I like travelling, hiking and visiting new places. I aim to visit all the states in the US. This was somethine I had from back home where I visited a lot of hilly areas in Nepal and travel almost the width of the country. Besides travelling, I like exploring new activities like kayaking, ice skaiting, river tubing and so on.

<p>When I am doing nothing, I like to try making new dishes following online recipes. I love cooking and making people try my dises (I cook good ;p). I also like eating outside and trying new cuisines. I am a level 6 google guide and love to explore new food places and give reviews and take pretty food pictures. You can check my <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/66sZRY7fr1Lsrh3C9?g_st=ic"><strong>google guide profile</strong></a> and see all my reviews and contributions.
